This module provides a simulation of diffusion within a region obstructed by a lattice of immobile beads of varying radii. This is a  simulation of microscopic crowding effects leading to diffusivity variations, when seen on a larger scale. For more details see Appendix 7 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03048.

- **To test** that the module works on your system, launch

 `py.test simLattice`

 from the parent folder. Make sure you are using python 3. Satisfy all missing packages.

- **To try out** the code, checkout `example.py` and feel free to play around with it. To launch the file after modifications, you need to go to the parent folder and execute the file in the terminal as a part of Python module by typing

 `python3 -m simLattice.example`

 Make sure `python3` is defined on your system.
